					<h4 style="color:black;">INTRODUCING YULA - A NEW KIND OF ENERGY DRINK, INSPIRED BY THE POWER FOUND DEEP WITHIN THE AMAZON.</h4>
			<p>A place of breath-taking natural beauty, our reforestation project is located in a zone of the Amazon that has been ravaged by slash and burn agriculture. Deforestation here has had a devasting impact on the environment, the wildlife and the local people but we’re determined to make a real difference. Our tree planting programme will restore 212 hectares of rainforest, offset 5443 tons of CO2 and support 342 farming families. The project is located in the buffer zone between Tambopata 	National Reserve, Bahuaja-Sonene National Park, and the city of Puerto Maldonado. It is home to some incredible species that have disappeared in other places. Rebuilding the rainforest here will help conserve the habitat for more than 30 high-conservation value species. This includes YULA’s spirit animals (a.k.a. the characters on our cans); the eye-catching blue macaw, the acrobatic spider monkey and the awesome panther. We want to see these animals survive and thrive.

			<h4 style="color:black;">"Made with organic and sustainably sourced ingredients, and 100% natural energy."</h4>

				<p><br>We’re determined that YULA has maximum uplift * for you, minimum impact for the planet.  This means more to us than sticking ‘organic’ on a can and thinking we’re done. That’s why we’ve committed to planting 250,000 trees in the Amazon by 2021, through our partnership with reforestation non-profit One Tree Planted.</p>

				<p>	We’ve worked really hard to find ingredients and packaging that meet our ethical standards. We’re proud to say YULA is made with organic ingredients, all our plant-based ingredients are sustainably sourced and our green tea is certified by the Rainforest Alliance. Plus our cans are 100% recyclable</p>
